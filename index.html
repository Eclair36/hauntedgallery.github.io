        <p class="intro"> Welcome friends, to The Haunted Gallery.</p>
        <p class="intro">I'm David Hopkins, renowned art critic and amateur collector. If you've stumbled on this page it means
        you've been invited to a viewing that few people know about. You are one of the privileged few to ever see my secret collection. As the cryptid is to the zoologist so the haunted painting is to the art collector. Whether it is a painting made from the blood of a suicidal artist, or the innocent picture of a child that seems to have arsonistic tendencies. Here you will find a collection of the very best, or rather most hideous, the art world has to offer.   </p>

                <p>The Hands Resist Him was painted by Bill Stoneham for commision in 1972. The image was based on a photograph taken of him and a neighbourhood girl when he was five. The title is based on a poem written by Stomeham's wife.</p>

                    <p>The hands on the door depict other lives and possibilities. The glass panes represent the separation between this world and the world of dreams. The doll is a guide who will lead the boy through.</p>
                    
                    It was shown in a gallery in Beverly Hills in 1974 where it was reviewed by a critic from the LA Times. It was purchased by the actor John Marley who appeared in the movie The Godfather. </p>

                <p>It resurfaced again in 2000 when it was listed on eBay. The seller was urgent to sell it because he believed it was haunted. Their four and half year old daughter said she was kept awake by the sound of the boy and girl fighting in the middle the night. </p>

                <p>It was bought by gallery owner Kim Smith for 1,000 dollars. Smith has reported no supernatural occurences. He has received 6 figure offers for the painting but has held on to it. 
                </p>

                <p>It is often referred to as "The Haunted Ebay Painting". You can find the original ebay listing <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/307/384/ff8.png">here</a></p>

            <div class="des1">
                        <p>The Crying Boy is a mass produced painting originally painted by Giovanni Bragolin, a pseudonym of Bruno Amadio. Amadio painted 20-30 crying child pictures after training in Venice in 1945. It was distributed from 1950 onwards. Prints of the picture were sold in department stores throughout the seventies.</p>
        
                            <p>The picture gained its cursed status in the 80’s in Britain when members of the fire brigade reported finding the painting unscathed in houses that had been gutted by fire. </p>

                            <p>The legend behind the picture itself is that it depicts an orphan whose parents died in a fire. Whichever
                                home he went to next, the legend says, there would be a fire, earning him the 
                                nickname: "Diablo"
                            </p>
        
                        <p>On September 4, 1985, British tabloid The Sun published “Blazing Curse of the Crying Boy Picture!” They told readers to send in their crying boy pictures so they could be destroyed. They were soon inundated with the pictures. They later organised a massive bonfire near the river Thames.</p>
        
                        <p>Journalist David Clark researched the Crying Boy for Fortean Times. He found that the paintings were treated with a flame-retardant varnish and printed on compressed board, which doesn’t burn easily. During a house fire, the string holding the painting would burn and it would fall down, protecting it from the flames.

            </div>
    <div class="des1">
                <p>Very little is known about this painting which only adds to its mystery. It is owned by one Sean Robinson from Cumbria England who inherited it from his Grandmother. His Grandmother had it in her attic for years and always claimed it was haunted. The story goes that it was made by an artist who mixed his blood with the paint and took his life soon after.</p>

                    <p>According to Robinson, after he hung the painting in his house he experienced strange phenomenona like hearing noises and waking up
                        to see the dark figure of a man sitting at the end of his bed and crying. He has described other cookie cutter phenomena like doors 
                        slamming and ghostly "orbs" being recorded near the painting.
                    </p>

                <p>I'm not very convinced by this one. The story sounds like something made out of whole cloth and there is no historical evidence
                    of its unhappy creator. There is a "Most Haunted" style video you can watch of people performing a seance on the picture, conducted in complete darkness of course. You can see the picture move, which isn't too impressive as two people
                    are clearly holding it. 
                </p>

                <p>The image fits what you would expect from a haunted painting at least. Add to that the owner Scott Robinson is a horror buff, as seen in the Pinhead decoractions when he's speaking to camera on his YouTube channel, and 
                    we can put this one down to a hoax or thinly veiled cry for attention.

                <h2>Man Proposes, God Disposes (Edwin Landseer, 1864)</h2>

                <p>Finally a painting with pedigree! Landseer was a Victorian painter, perhaps best known for his painting “The Monarch of the Glen” a beautiful picture of a stag which has become a national symbol of Scotland.</p>

                    <p>The painting depicts a grisly scene. Two polar bears gnawing on the remains of a ship. One has a blood red sail in its jaws while the other muches happily on human bones. A ship’s telescope lies in the snow. The title is a translation of the Latin phrase “Homo proponit, sed Deus disponit”. Today we would say “the best laid plans of mice and men.”
                    </p>

                <p>The painting is based on the ill-fated Franklin Expedition of 1845. There were two vessels, the HMS Erebus and the HMS Terror. They set off with a crew of 129 men in an attempt to chart the North Western passage which would link the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. After they entered the Artic they were never heard from again.
                </p>

                <p>An expedition ten years later found only scant wreckage, frozen bodies and terrible rumors. A study of the bones showed signs of cannibalism among the crew. When the story reached England it was met with fierce denial. How could civilized Englishmen ever stoop so low? The event was a blow to the confidence of the British Empire which was near its zenith at the time. Many of Landseer’s previous paintings were of cute dogs, so there were some who questioned if he had lost his mind.
                </p>

                <p>Today it hangs in Royal Holloway, University of London, where is has gained its cursed reputation. Legend has it that a student who was facing the painting during an exam killed himself by shoving a pencil in his eye. He wrote the words “the polar bears made me do it” on his exam paper. Since the 70’s it has been covered with a Union Jack during exams. Students believe that anyone who sits next to the uncovered painting will fail their exam. Not surprising considering it depicts one of Britain’s greatest failures.</p>
